#### NETFLIX CLONE USING HTML,CSS AND JAVASCRIPT.

This is a clone of Netflix website built using HTML, css and javascript as a Front-end. It's not a replica, and it doesn't have all the features of Netflix website. it's a similar version of Netflix with my own design touch, showing my abilities in HTML,CSS and Javascript to build something advanced like Netflix. It contains the home page, sign-in page, sign-up page.
